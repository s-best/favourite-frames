        <h2>DUNKIRK</h2>
        <p>
          It’s apt that this still is the first to be featured here, as this particular scene was what first gave me the idea for this blog. With all the tension experienced through the previous running time of the film, the final moments of Farrier’s (Tom Hardy) story is almost tranquil.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without going too far into the intricacies of Dunkirk’s storyline and Christopher Nolan’s portrayal of time throughout it, we see in this still the end of Farrier’s one hour flight. He’s engaged in multiple dog fights, in spite of his fuel gauge malfunctioning and saved innumerable lives. When he finally runs out of fuel and lands on the beach, he burns his spitfire and waits to be captured, watching the flames.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dense, rich darkness of the shot lends a muted colour palette, that creates a stunning contrast between the flames and the rest of the scene. The fire helps highlight Farrier against the background, a solemn figure standing in the waning light, resigned to his fate. In the very background, we see German soldiers approaching from the distance. From this we can infer Farrier’s probable capture as a prisoner of war, but he faces this with the same serenity conjured by the scene.
